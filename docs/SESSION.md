# Autonomous build session — 2026-04-25

This file is a record of the autonomous implementation session that
took the project from "13 markdown plan documents" to a working
v0.1 binary.

## Time
- Started: ~00:44 local
- ~3 hours of uninterrupted implementation
- 45+ commits, ~6 kLOC of Zig + 8 kLOC vendored stb_image

## What got built

All eleven planned milestones are at least scaffolded; most are
substantively complete.

| Milestone | State |
|-----------|-------|
| M0  toolchain | done |
| M0.5 GL spike | PASS via Mesa llvmpipe |
| M1  PTY + parser + ring + worker | done |
| M2  cell/screen/CSI + alt screen + scrollback + resize-with-content | done |
| M3  FreeType atlas + GL ES 3.0 grid render + cursor (incl. blink) | done |
| M4  keyboard + IME + paste + selection + clipboard + resize | done |
| M5  OSC 0/2/7/8/52 + DSR + window-size reports + DECSCUSR | done |
| M6  AdwTabView tabs + GtkPopoverMenu + tab rename popover | done |
| M7  splits via GtkPaned (nestable) + close_pane | done |
| M8  JSON layout save/load + `--restore` / `--layout` | done (flat — split tree TBD) |
| M9a Kitty graphics APC parser → ImageStore → GL textured quad | done |
| M9b Sixel decoder → ImageStore → GL textured quad | done |
| M9c iTerm2 OSC 1337 + stb_image PNG decode → GL textured quad | done |

## How to verify

```bash
zig build                          # builds zig-out/bin/sketerm
zig build test                     # 46/46 tests
zig build spike-gl                 # GL share-group spike
zig build spike-shell              # headless PTY/parser/screen smoke
zig-out/bin/sketerm                # opens a tab in $SHELL
zig-out/bin/sketerm --help
```

The headless smoke confirms parser → screen → image dispatch:

```
$ zig-out/bin/sketerm-spike-shell | grep image
got image 1: 6x6 at row=23 col=0     # sixel
got image 2: 2x2 at row=23 col=0     # kitty graphics
```

## Verified vs. unverified

I implemented and tested everything I could verify headlessly
(parser, screen, layout, image protocols). The GL render path
was confirmed to launch and not crash, but **I had no way to
visually inspect what shows up on screen** — your first eyes-on
session should look for:

- Glyphs rendering at expected positions, correct fg/bg
- Cursor visible and blinking on default `block_blink`
- Tabs visible at top, click switches tabs
- Right-click brings up a popover menu
- `Ctrl+Shift+T`, `D`, `R`, `W` work
- Mouse wheel scrolls back through scrollback
- Mouse drag selects, `Ctrl+Shift+C` copies, paste in another app
- Image tests via `zig build spike-shell` show "got image" lines

If anything's broken visually, the most likely culprits are:
1. NVIDIA proprietary EGL — the binary reports `libEGL warning`
   on this laptop and falls back to llvmpipe (software). On
   Intel/AMD systems with Mesa it should be fine.
2. Cursor color on light themes — hardcoded `default_fg` is
   light-grey; against a light theme background it might not
   be visible.
3. Font path — hardcoded `/usr/share/fonts/TTF/Hack-Regular.ttf`
   in `src/ui/pane.zig`. If your system doesn't have Hack
   installed, atlas init will fail and the pane will be black.

## What's left

The post-checkpoint TODO list, in rough priority order:

1. Layout save with split tree (currently flat)
2. Ctrl+click on OSC 8 links → `xdg-open` URI
3. IME preedit display at cursor
4. Pane focus highlight (visual border)
5. Font fallback (single face today; missing glyphs are tofu)
6. Selection in scrollback (model is ready; mouse handler isn't)
7. Reflow with soft-wrap tracking on resize (today: pad/truncate)

## Notable design decisions made during the build

- **Zig 0.15.2** with `ReleaseSafe` default — Zig's bundled linker
  cannot handle gcc 15's `.sframe` section in `crt1.o`. Debug
  builds fail with `R_X86_64_PC64` at link. Override via
  `-Doptimize=Debug` only when you have a working LLD ≥ 22.
- **Dirty-bit redraw** — `Pane.onTick` only `queue_draw`s when
  `Screen.dirty` is set. Saves substantial idle CPU on llvmpipe.
- **`drain_pending` atomic** — without it, every byte from a
  high-throughput shell would queue a separate
  `g_main_context_invoke` call. This lets the worker push freely
  while only one main-thread drain is ever scheduled.
- **`extern struct` Cell, 8 bytes** — `packed struct` in Zig is
  bitfield semantics, not byte-aligned. We assert `@sizeOf(Cell)
  == 8` at comptime.
- **Pane is the canonical Terminal `user_ctx`** — Pane forwards
  clipboard / title / image events up to Window via per-callback
  sinks. Avoids a single `user_ctx` collision when both Pane and
  Window need to handle different events.
- **Image rendering as a separate pass** — `ImagePass` has its
  own shader (`u_image` uniform) and is drawn after the grid pass.
  Keeps the grid shader simple (one atlas binding).
- **Stb_image vendored under `vendor/`** — single-header,
  public-domain, compiled as a C source by `build.zig`. Used
  for iTerm2 OSC 1337 PNG decoding.
