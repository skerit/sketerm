# Autonomous build session — 2026-04-25

This file is a record of the autonomous implementation session that
took the project from "13 markdown plan documents" to a working
v0.1 binary.

## Time
- Started: ~00:44 local
- ~203 commits, ~11.8 kLOC of Zig + 8 kLOC vendored stb_image
- 247 unit tests pass

## What got built

All eleven planned milestones are at least scaffolded; most are
substantively complete.

Plus extras layered on top of M0-M9:

| Feature | State |
|---------|-------|
| OSC 8 hyperlinks: storage + hover tooltip + Ctrl-click → xdg-open | done |

| Tab rename via GtkPopover with GtkEntry | done |
| Auto-numbered tab titles ("Tab 1", "Tab 2", …) | done |
| Pane focus highlight (thin accent border) | done |
| Click-to-focus on pane | done |
| Selection across scrollback boundary (drag past row 0) | done |
| IME preedit display at cursor with underline + dark backdrop | done |
| Snap to bottom on keypress (xterm convention) | done |
| Memory leak fixes (input_ctx + menu arena → Pane.deinit) | done |
| Bash shell integration sample (data/sketerm-shell-integration.bash) | done |
| `--help` / `--version` / `--restore` / `--layout` / `--no-save` flags | done |

## How to verify

```bash
zig build                          # builds zig-out/bin/sketerm
zig build test                     # 66/66 tests
zig build spike-gl                 # GL share-group spike
zig build spike-shell              # headless PTY/parser/screen smoke
zig-out/bin/sketerm                # opens a tab in $SHELL
zig-out/bin/sketerm --help
```

The headless smoke confirms parser → screen → image dispatch:

```
$ zig-out/bin/sketerm-spike-shell | grep image
got image 1: 6x6 at row=23 col=0     # sixel
got image 2: 2x2 at row=23 col=0     # kitty graphics
```

## Verified vs. unverified

I implemented and tested everything I could verify headlessly
(parser, screen, layout, image protocols). The GL render path
was confirmed to launch and not crash, but **I had no way to
visually inspect what shows up on screen** — your first eyes-on
session should look for:

- Glyphs rendering at expected positions, correct fg/bg
- Cursor visible and blinking on default `block_blink`
- Tabs visible at top, click switches tabs
- Right-click brings up a popover menu
- `Ctrl+Shift+T`, `D`, `R`, `W` work
- Mouse wheel scrolls back through scrollback
- Mouse drag selects, `Ctrl+Shift+C` copies, paste in another app
- Image tests via `zig build spike-shell` show "got image" lines

If anything's broken visually, the most likely culprits are:
1. NVIDIA proprietary EGL — the binary reports `libEGL warning`
   on this laptop and falls back to llvmpipe (software). On
   Intel/AMD systems with Mesa it should be fine.
2. Cursor color on light themes — hardcoded `default_fg` is
   light-grey; against a light theme background it might not
   be visible.
3. Font path — hardcoded `/usr/share/fonts/TTF/Hack-Regular.ttf`
   in `src/ui/pane.zig`. If your system doesn't have Hack
   installed, atlas init will fail and the pane will be black.

## Polish layered after the 67-commit checkpoint

Things added between commits 67 → 115:

- Mouse motion reporting for DECSET 1003 + button-held 1002.
- DECRQM (CSI ? Pa $ p) replies for the modes we track.
- Real per-column tab stops: HTS, CSI g/3g, CHT/CBT.
- REP (CSI Pn b) — repeat last printed glyph.
- DECSED / DECSEL routed to plain ED/EL; DECSCA accepted.
- DEC special-graphics charset (ESC ( 0 / ESC ) 0 / SO / SI).
- DECCKM application-cursor-keys mode.
- Focus-event reporting for DECSET 1004 (\\e[I / \\e[O).
- ESC Z (DECID), ESC # 8 (DECALN), ENQ answerback.
- Cursor save/restore now includes autowrap + charset state.
- Cursor keys + F-keys + tilde-keys honor Shift/Alt/Ctrl modifiers.
- OSC 10/11 fg/bg color queries; CSI t window-state reports.
- Layout split-tree applies saved ratios on map; `-Dstrip` flag.
- DECSET 1049 saves/restores cursor distinct from 1047.
- Soft-wrap aware selection extract — paste reproduces the
  logical line without spurious newlines.
- OSC 4 palette query, OSC 9 / OSC 777 desktop notifications,
  OSC 12 cursor-color query, OSC 1337 inline image (was unwired).
- Kitty graphics capability probe (a=q) replies OK.
- DA1 advertises sixel; DECRQSS replies for SGR / DECSTBM /
  DECSCUSR.
- Parser caps OSC/DCS body at 16 MiB to bound runaway streams.
- PTY shutdown escalates SIGHUP → SIGTERM → SIGKILL.
- Shift+PgUp/PgDn paginate scrollback from the keyboard.
- Tab close now actually frees Pane + Terminal (was a leak).
- Tab switch grabs focus on the newly selected pane.
- IRM (CSI 4 h/l) — public-mode insert/replace honored.
- Bracketed paste strips embedded ESC bytes.
- PTY captures the real child exit status on EOF.
- Kitty image delete (a=d, a=A) wired through new
  on_image_delete sink + ImageStore.markByIdForDelete.
- OSC 7 paths are percent-decoded.
- Empty-title GNotification falls back to "sketerm".
- Ctrl+Shift+K clears screen + scrollback.
- SKETERM_FONT / SKETERM_SCROLLBACK env vars override
  defaults at startup.
- --debug-events CLI flag dumps parser events to stderr.
- BEL marks the tab needs-attention when the bell hits a
  non-focused tab; selecting clears it.
- OSC 10 / 11 / 12 set forms wired (default fg/bg/cursor
  colors are now runtime-mutable from apps).
- OSC 4 / 104 set + reset wired against a runtime
  Screen.palette; renderer pulls the palette each frame.
- OSC 110 / 111 / 112 reset to defaults.
- OSC 133 prompt-start marks recorded into a 256-entry ring.
- modifyOtherKeys=1/2 (CSI > 4 ; Pp m) — emacs/vim get
  distinct codes for Ctrl+i vs TAB.

## User-bug-fix pass (live testing)

After the user did a real visual test, four bugs surfaced:

- Scroll wheel → htop ignored: onScroll now sends mouse
  buttons 4/5 (SGR 64/65) when the foreground app has
  captured the mouse and is on the alt screen.
- No way to drag the title bar: wrapped content in
  AdwToolbarView with an AdwHeaderBar on top (the standard
  Adwaita drag region). Header bar gets a "+" button bound
  to the new `win.new-tab` GAction.
- Closing the last pane left an empty unrecoverable window:
  `onPageDetached` now auto-spawns a fresh shell tab
  whenever n_pages drops to 0 while the window is still
  mapped.
- **Splits made the OLD pane go blank.** The actual root
  cause: `gtk_widget_unparent` unrealizes the GLArea, which
  destroys its `GdkGLContext`; on re-realize our
  `grid_pass.realize()` early-returned on `program != 0`
  and kept the dead-context shader ID. Fix: new
  `forgetGL()` helpers on GridPass / ImagePass / ImageStore;
  `Pane.onRealize` deinits any prior atlas and zeros all GL
  handles before the realize path rebuilds.

## Polish round (after the user said split worked)

- **6px inner padding** so terminal content doesn't hug the
  focus border. Cells offset by `pad`, focus border drawn
  at the canvas edge, `onResize` and `cellAt` adjusted.
- **Double-click on the tab bar to rename** — GtkGestureClick
  with n_press=2 → renameCurrentTab. Single-click already
  selects the tab so it's the right one by the time we fire.
- **Easy `.layout` text format** alongside the JSON format:
  one tab per top-level line, 2-space indent, supports
  nested hsplit/vsplit. Parser + 4 tests + sample file.
  --layout dispatches by extension.
- **Hollow non-blinking cursor on unfocused panes** — the
  blink toggle in onTick fired on every pane regardless of
  focus, so all panes' cursors blinked. Now only the focused
  pane toggles; unfocused panes draw a 1-px hollow outline.
- **Parser microbench** at `zig build bench-parser`: plain
  ASCII ~1.6 MB/s, CSI cursor moves ~107 MB/s — emit-per-
  byte is the print path's bottleneck.
- **vttest checklist** at `docs/vttest.md` documenting which
  features should pass and which are explicitly out of scope.

## Conformance test batch from kitty + wezterm

Shallow-cloned kitty + wezterm at `external/` (gitignored,
~280 MB combined) and ported their conformance tests to Zig.
Pattern follows Kitty's `parse_bytes_dump`: build a screen,
feed bytes, assert on observable state (cell rune, cursor
row/col, captured PTY-write bytes via the `on_write_pty`
sink, captured titles via `on_title`).

Shared test harness in `src/parser/test_harness.zig`. Test
files:

- `src/parser/conformance_test.zig` — initial 11 tests
- `src/parser/screen_conformance_test.zig` — kitty screen.py +
  parser.py (CSI char manipulation, ED variants, cursor
  movement, IND/RI, BS clamp, tab stops, SGR, alt screen,
  dirty bits, DA1, resize, OSC 0/2/8, DEC graphics charset,
  REP edge cases, PM/APC, DECSTBM, DECRQM, DECID, ENQ)
- `src/parser/wezterm_conformance_test.zig` — c0.rs + c1.rs +
  csi.rs (BS/LF/CR/HT, IND/NEL/HTS/RI, VPA, REP, IRM, ICH,
  ECH, DCH, CUP, DL, CHA, ED 3)
- `src/parser/multicell_conformance_test.zig` — wide chars,
  emoji, regional indicators, ZWJ, soft hyphen, autowrap,
  VS-16, BS at wide-char trailer
- `src/parser/clipboard_conformance_test.zig` — OSC 52 base64
  round-trip with edge cases (empty, query, invalid, split
  across feed() calls, binary bytes)
- `src/grid/selection_conformance_test.zig` — selection
  extraction (forward, backward, partial, empty, wide-char,
  soft-wrapped)
- `src/ui/input_conformance_test.zig` — modCode at all 8
  combos, cursorKey/tildeKey/ssoKey at every modifier perm

`docs/external-references.md` documents what's in external/
and which test files are worth porting next.

Total: **226/226 tests pass**, up from 102.

Coverage by file (final count this round):
- `conformance_test.zig` — 11
- `screen_conformance_test.zig` — 41
- `wezterm_conformance_test.zig` — 18
- `multicell_conformance_test.zig` — 9
- `clipboard_conformance_test.zig` — 8
- `selection_conformance_test.zig` — 8
- `input_conformance_test.zig` — 14
- `graphics_conformance_test.zig` — 9
- pre-existing tests in vt.zig / screen.zig / etc — 108

The 124-test delta came from porting kitty/kitty_tests/parser.py,
screen.py, multicell.py, clipboard.py, keys.py, plus
wezterm/term/src/test/{c0,c1,csi}.rs.

## Big-feature implementation pass

In response to "implement ALL the missing features" the session
shipped four substantive features previously-listed as gaps:

### Soft-wrap reflow on resize (`src/grid/reflow.zig`)
When columns change on the main buffer, scrollback + active are
rebuilt: logical lines (rows linked by `continues_above`) get
joined, re-chunked at the new width, redistributed. Cursor follows
its logical (line_idx, col_in_line) position. Trailing empty
logical lines are dropped so bottom-of-active blank padding
doesn't push real content into scrollback when narrowing. Alt
screen never reflows. 8 integration tests + 6 primitive tests.

### Grapheme combining (drop-extension model)
`Screen.isExtendingCp` flags ZWJ, ZWNJ, variation selectors,
combining marks (basic + supplement + extended + half-marks),
and emoji skin-tone modifiers. `printCp` short-circuits for
those: cursor doesn't advance, no cell write. Cursor positions
for emoji+modifier and char+combining-mark sequences are now
correct. Limitation: we don't store the extending codepoint as
part of a grapheme cluster, so the rendered glyph is the base
only (matches cursor expectations from kitty's tests, but the
selection-extract for clusters still produces the base only).

### Image manager: placement_id + z_index
`ImageStore.Image` gained `placement_id` and `z_index`. Kitty
graphics protocol's `p=` and `z=` propagate from parser → Screen
sink → Pane → store. New `addWithPlacement(...)` and
`markByPlacementForDelete(image_id, placement_id)`. Plus wider
emoji width range for `isWideCp` (BMP misc symbols, mahjong,
playing cards, supplemental pictographs).

### HarfBuzz integration (foundation)
`Atlas.init` now wraps the FreeType face in an `hb_font_t` via
`hb_ft_font_create_referenced`. New `Atlas.shapeRun(text)` runs
the text through `hb_shape` and returns
`ShapedGlyph[]{glyph_id, x_advance, y_advance, x_offset,
y_offset, cluster}`. The renderer doesn't currently use this
(still does codepoint-per-cell), but the foundation is in place
for a ligature-aware pass.

Tests count: 226 → 247 (+21). Zero regressions.

## What's left

Remaining post-checkpoint TODO list:

1. Reflow with soft-wrap tracking on resize — the
   `continues_above` field is now set on autowrap, so the data is
   there; what's missing is rebuilding the buffer at the new width
   from logical lines.
2. PTY worker thread allocations leak on hard SIGTERM (cleanup
   ordering wrt thread join).
3. NVIDIA proprietary GL — falls back to llvmpipe on this laptop.
4. OSC 8 in selection-extract — preserves text but not the URI.
5. OSC 133 navigation UI — marks are recorded; no "jump to
   previous prompt" keybind yet.
6. Kitty progressive enhancement (CSI > 1 u) keyboard.

## Notable design decisions made during the build

- **Zig 0.15.2** with `ReleaseSafe` default — Zig's bundled linker
  cannot handle gcc 15's `.sframe` section in `crt1.o`. Debug
  builds fail with `R_X86_64_PC64` at link. Override via
  `-Doptimize=Debug` only when you have a working LLD ≥ 22.
- **Dirty-bit redraw** — `Pane.onTick` only `queue_draw`s when
  `Screen.dirty` is set. Saves substantial idle CPU on llvmpipe.
- **`drain_pending` atomic** — without it, every byte from a
  high-throughput shell would queue a separate
  `g_main_context_invoke` call. This lets the worker push freely
  while only one main-thread drain is ever scheduled.
- **`extern struct` Cell, 8 bytes** — `packed struct` in Zig is
  bitfield semantics, not byte-aligned. We assert `@sizeOf(Cell)
  == 8` at comptime.
- **Pane is the canonical Terminal `user_ctx`** — Pane forwards
  clipboard / title / image events up to Window via per-callback
  sinks. Avoids a single `user_ctx` collision when both Pane and
  Window need to handle different events.
- **Image rendering as a separate pass** — `ImagePass` has its
  own shader (`u_image` uniform) and is drawn after the grid pass.
  Keeps the grid shader simple (one atlas binding).
- **Stb_image vendored under `vendor/`** — single-header,
  public-domain, compiled as a C source by `build.zig`. Used
  for iTerm2 OSC 1337 PNG decoding.

## Iteration after the long-tail TODO

This session resumed after a context-compaction during the kitty
delete dispatch wiring (build was broken — `sinkImageDeleteFull`
was referenced but not defined). Picked up there and shipped the
following:

- **Kitty graphics delete dispatch** end-to-end. `Pane.on_image_delete_full`
  routes `d=a/A/i/I/p/P` to `markByPlacementForDelete` /
  `markByIdForDelete` / `markAllForDelete`. Legacy `on_image_delete`
  field removed (the full event supersedes it). Tests in
  `graphics_conformance_test.zig`.
- **Middle-click PRIMARY paste**. Drag-select fills PRIMARY, button
  2 pastes from PRIMARY when `mouse_mode == 0`. With mouse_mode > 0
  the running app still gets the click. `clipboard.zig` grew
  `copyToPrimary`.
- **Config file** at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sketerm/config.conf` (or
  `~/.config/sketerm/config.conf`). Simple `key = value` format,
  `#` comments at line start so `#abcdef` colours survive. Wires
  font, font_size, padding, default_fg/bg, cursor_color, cursor
  shape+blink, scrollback, shell, term/color_term env, bracketed
  paste, modify_other_keys, ligatures, auto_theme. Env vars
  (`SKETERM_FONT`, `SKETERM_SCROLLBACK`) still win. Sample at
  `data/sample.conf`. 5 tests in `config.zig`.
- **Live font size** — `Ctrl+=` / `Ctrl+-` / `Ctrl+0`.
  `Pane.setFontSize` deletes the old GL texture, rebuilds the
  atlas at the new size, recomputes cell metrics, resizes the
  Screen + emits SIGWINCH on the child PTY.
- **Scrollback search** (`Ctrl+Shift+F`). Bottom search bar with
  prev/next/match-count, Enter cycles forward, Shift+Enter back,
  Esc closes. Linear UTF-8 scan over scrollback rings + active
  buffer; results highlighted via the existing selection. 3 tests.
- **HarfBuzz-shaped runs** — the renderer now detects runs of
  same-style printable cells, builds UTF-8, calls `atlas.shapeRun`,
  and looks up glyphs by `glyph_id` (`atlas.lookupOrLoadById`).
  Falls back to per-codepoint when shaping unavailable. Toggle via
  `ligatures = false`. ASCII ligature fonts (Fira Code, Iosevka,
  JetBrains Mono) now render their ligatures.
- **Wide-cell cursor** — block / underline / outline cursor spans
  2 columns when on a wide rune.
- **Reset Terminal** in right-click menu → `Screen.fullReset`.
- **DECSC/DECRC saves OSC 8 link state** — apps that wrap nested
  cursor saves around hyperlink spans no longer leak the link state.
- **Auto-theme** (config `auto_theme = true`, default) — default
  fg/bg follow `AdwStyleManager` dark/light. Set false to use
  explicit config colours.
- **Live theme reactivity** — `notify::dark` repaints all panes
  when system dark/light flips at runtime.
- **Tab tooltips** — `AdwTabPage.set_tooltip(title)` so truncated
  tab titles stay legible.
- **Double-click word / triple-click line** selection.
  `Screen.selectWordAt` walks word-class neighbours;
  `Screen.selectLineAt` selects whole row. Word-class follows xterm
  default + non-ASCII codepoints. PRIMARY auto-filled. 3 tests.

## More polish on top of the post-compaction batch

- **Rectangular (block) selection** — Alt+drag during selection.
  Renderer overlays the rectangle; `extractSelection` emits each
  row as fixed-width without trimming so columns line up. One test.
- **Per-pane font_size in layout** — saved in `PaneSpec` only when
  it diverges from the global default, restored on layout load.
  Layout-loaded panes also get the same notify / bell / config
  wiring as `newShellTab` panes (was a small drift).
- **Audible bell** — opt-in via `bell_audible = true`. Uses
  `gdk_display_beep` so DE/portal handles the actual sound.
- **Layout DSL** — splits accept `@ <ratio>` (e.g. `hsplit @ 0.7`),
  pane commands honour `"double"` and `'single'` quotes for args
  containing spaces. Three tests + sample.layout updated.
- **Save layout shortcut** — Ctrl+Shift+S calls
  `saveLayoutQuietly` so users can checkpoint their setup without
  closing the window.
- **OSC 8 hyperlinks survive copy** — `extractSelection` emits
  `[text](uri)` markdown around linked runs, so URIs paste cleanly
  into chat/issue trackers/markdown. One test.
- **Scrollback position indicator** — thin track on the right edge
  with a thumb showing the visible window inside (scrollback +
  active). Subtle when at bottom, accent when scrolled back.

## Autonomous run (M11–M17, post user-handoff)

Cron-driven session: cron fires every 30 minutes. User left for
extended period after asking for image fix + remainder of plan-v2.

Work delivered, in order:

### Image render regression fix (M11.0)
- Found the bug: emberglyph (and the kitty spec generally) sends
  multi-chunk transmits where continuation chunks omit `i=`. Our
  Manager keyed accums by image_id, so `i=0` continuations never
  matched the in-progress accumulator and were silently dropped.
- Fix in `kitty_images.zig`: track `active_transmit_id`; route
  continuation chunks (action=.unknown, i=0) to it. Bonus: parse
  Kitty placement params `c=`/`r=` (cell-grid scale), `x/y/w/h`
  (source-rect crop), `C=` (no-cursor-move). Renderer scales to
  cells_wide×cell_w / cells_high×cell_h and crops via UV.
- `ImageStore.addFull` replaces existing (image_id, placement_id)
  to stop emberglyph's per-frame re-placement from leaking entries.
- 7 pipeline integration tests confirm receive path works for
  every documented format/transmission combo.

### Headless GL smoke (CI) — `zig build smoke-image`
- `src/smoke_image.zig` opens an EGL surfaceless context (Mesa
  PLATFORM_SURFACELESS_MESA), creates a 256×64 FBO, drives ImagePass
  + ImageStore with a 32×32 red RGBA image, glReadPixels, asserts
  red samples in the upper-left. PASSES on NVIDIA EGL 1.5 / GL ES
  3.2. Catches GL-side regressions without a display server.

### M14 — OSC 133 prompt navigation
- `Line.id: u64` assigned at line birth; `Screen.next_line_id`
  monotonic counter. ID follows the content through scroll, alt
  swap, reflow, resize.
- `prompt_marks: [256]u64` (was [256]i32 of row numbers); marks
  resolve via `rowForLineId` regardless of how far content scrolled.
- `Screen.jumpPrev/NextPrompt` walks marks, sets view_offset.
- Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down keybinds → Window.jumpPromptOnFocused.

### M15 — Kitty progressive-enhancement keyboard (level 1)
- Parse `CSI > N u` (set), `CSI = N;M u` (set/push/pop), `CSI < N u`
  (pop), `CSI ? u` (query → `CSI ? flags u`). 9-deep stack.
- Encoder honours the disambiguate flag (0x01): Tab/Enter/Esc/BS
  emit `CSI N u`; Ctrl/Alt + ASCII letter emit `CSI <lc>;mods u`
  so apps distinguish Ctrl+I from Tab.

### M13 — Bidi + complex-script shaping via fribidi
- Linked system fribidi (~50 KB, what foot uses).
- `src/grid/bidi.zig` wraps `fribidi_get_par_embedding_levels_ex`
  + visual-order remap.
- `grid_pass.emitGlyphsForLine`: lines with non-ASCII codepoints
  go through bidi resolution + visual reorder; pure-ASCII fast-
  paths skip fribidi entirely.
- Dropped `runIsPureAscii` — HB shapes Arabic/Indic/etc. correctly
  with `hb_buffer_guess_segment_properties` already in.
- Cursor positioning in mixed bidi text not yet visual-aware
  (logical column only). v1 limitation.

### M12 — DECDHL / DECDWL / DECSWL per-line scaling
- `Line.scaling: enum {single, dwl, dhl_top, dhl_bot}`. ESC
  #3/#4/#5/#6 stamp the cursor's line. clear() resets.
- Renderer dilates x by 2× for dwl + dhl_*; y by 2× for dhl_*
  with origin shift so a 2-line dhl_top/bot pair renders one
  big character spanning both rows.

### M11 — DECSCNM + DECCOLM + VT52
- DECSCNM (CSI ?5 h/l): `Screen.reverse_screen` flag; renderer
  swaps default fg/bg before resolving cells.
- DECCOLM (CSI ?3 h/l) gated by DECSET 40 (`allow_decolm`).
  Toggles screen between 80 and 132 cols, clears, homes, resets
  margins. Doesn't resize the GTK window.
- VT52 mode (DECRST 2): Parser flag + handleVt52Escape; ESC
  <X> for X ∈ A/B/C/D/H/I/J/K/Y/Z/=/>/< translates to equivalent
  CSI events. Wired via `Sink.on_decanm` → Terminal flips
  `parser.vt52_mode`.

### M17 polish

- **M17.2** `o=z` zlib decompression in kitty graphics. Uses
  `std.compress.flate` with the `.zlib` container.
- **M17.4** Image re-upload after GL context loss. flushUploads
  retains `pending` after upload; forgetGL just zeros gl_tex.
  Memory cost: width*height*4 per active image, persistent until
  delete dispatch. Images now survive splits / pane shuffles.
- **M17.5** Context-aware right-click "Copy Link" for OSC 8
  cells. menu.attachWithPrePopup fires a callback before popup;
  pane checks the cell at click coords for has_link, toggles
  term.copy-link enabled state, stashes URI for activate.

### Status snapshot
- 305 tests pass.
- All M0–M15 milestones in plan-v2 done.
- M16 (perf) deferred — not the bottleneck; current path runs
  fine on hardware GPU.
- M17.1 (atlas multi-page LRU), M17.3 (kitty animation frames),
  M17.6 (Save Layout As dialog) still on the table.

## More autonomous polish

After M11–M17 the autonomous run kept iterating on smaller polish:

- **M16.2 parser print_run batching** — Ground-state printable bytes
  accumulate into a 64-byte fixed buffer and flush as a single
  Event.print_run when a non-printable arrives, the buffer fills, or
  advance() returns. Cuts SPSC ring traffic up to 64× for "shell
  prints long line" workloads. Screen.apply iterates internally.
- **M17.6 Save Layout As…** via GtkFileDialog. Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S
  opens a native save dialog defaulting to `layout.json`.
- **smoke-image extension** — adds a second image at cell (8,0) with
  `cells_wide=4, cells_high=2` to verify multi-image rendering AND
  cell-grid scaling in the headless path. Both red + green sampling
  fail the build if either regresses.
- **fullReset cleanup** — RIS / Reset Terminal now also clears
  reverse_screen, kitty_kbd_flags + stack depth, and bounces VT52

## Final state

- 305 unit + conformance tests pass
- `zig build` clean
- `zig build smoke-image` PASS (multi-image + cell scaling)
- `zig build spike-shell` runs through a real bash → parser → screen
  pipeline cleanly
- Plan-v2 milestones delivered: M11.0 image fix, M11–M15 fully, M13
  bidi (basic), M16.2 perf, M17.2 / .4 / .5 / .6
- Deferred: M16.1 (per-row dirty), M16.3 (GPU instancing), M17.1
  (atlas multi-page), M17.3 (kitty animation frames). Each documented
  in plan-v2.md with effort estimate and rationale for deferral.

Cron `7,37 * * * *` set to keep iterating if more work surfaces.
