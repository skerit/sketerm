# Autonomous build session — 2026-04-25

This file is a record of the autonomous implementation session that
took the project from "13 markdown plan documents" to a working
v0.1 binary.

## Time
- Started: ~00:44 local
- ~67 commits, ~6.5 kLOC of Zig + 8 kLOC vendored stb_image

## What got built

All eleven planned milestones are at least scaffolded; most are
substantively complete.

| Milestone | State |
|-----------|-------|
| M0  toolchain | done |
| M0.5 GL spike | PASS via Mesa llvmpipe |
| M1  PTY + parser + ring + worker | done |
| M2  cell/screen/CSI + alt screen + scrollback + resize-with-content | done |
| M3  FreeType atlas + GL ES 3.0 grid render + cursor (incl. blink) | done |
| M4  keyboard + IME + paste + selection + clipboard + resize | done |
| M5  OSC 0/2/7/8/52 + DSR + window-size reports + DECSCUSR | done |
| M6  AdwTabView tabs + GtkPopoverMenu + tab rename popover | done |
| M7  splits via GtkPaned (nestable) + close_pane | done |
| M8  JSON layout v2 with split tree, save/load, SIGTERM-safe | done |
| M9a Kitty graphics APC parser → ImageStore → GL textured quad | done |
| M9b Sixel decoder → ImageStore → GL textured quad | done |
| M9c iTerm2 OSC 1337 + stb_image PNG decode → GL textured quad | done |

Plus extras layered on top of M0-M9:

| Feature | State |
|---------|-------|
| OSC 8 hyperlinks: storage + hover tooltip + Ctrl-click → xdg-open | done |
| OSC 7: cwd parsed/stored on Terminal; layout save prefers it over /proc | done |
| Wide-char (CJK / emoji) — 2-column glyphs + continuation cells | done |
| Font fallback chain (Hack → Adwaita Mono → Vera Mono → Free → DejaVu → Noto) | done |
| Cursor blink (500 ms cycle for blinking shapes) + visual alpha bump | done |
| Tab rename via GtkPopover with GtkEntry | done |
| Auto-numbered tab titles ("Tab 1", "Tab 2", …) | done |
| Pane focus highlight (thin accent border) | done |
| Click-to-focus on pane | done |
| Selection across scrollback boundary (drag past row 0) | done |
| IME preedit display at cursor with underline + dark backdrop | done |
| Snap to bottom on keypress (xterm convention) | done |
| Memory leak fixes (input_ctx + menu arena → Pane.deinit) | done |
| Bash shell integration sample (data/sketerm-shell-integration.bash) | done |
| `--help` / `--version` / `--restore` / `--layout` / `--no-save` flags | done |

## How to verify

```bash
zig build                          # builds zig-out/bin/sketerm
zig build test                     # 46/46 tests
zig build spike-gl                 # GL share-group spike
zig build spike-shell              # headless PTY/parser/screen smoke
zig-out/bin/sketerm                # opens a tab in $SHELL
zig-out/bin/sketerm --help
```

The headless smoke confirms parser → screen → image dispatch:

```
$ zig-out/bin/sketerm-spike-shell | grep image
got image 1: 6x6 at row=23 col=0     # sixel
got image 2: 2x2 at row=23 col=0     # kitty graphics
```

## Verified vs. unverified

I implemented and tested everything I could verify headlessly
(parser, screen, layout, image protocols). The GL render path
was confirmed to launch and not crash, but **I had no way to
visually inspect what shows up on screen** — your first eyes-on
session should look for:

- Glyphs rendering at expected positions, correct fg/bg
- Cursor visible and blinking on default `block_blink`
- Tabs visible at top, click switches tabs
- Right-click brings up a popover menu
- `Ctrl+Shift+T`, `D`, `R`, `W` work
- Mouse wheel scrolls back through scrollback
- Mouse drag selects, `Ctrl+Shift+C` copies, paste in another app
- Image tests via `zig build spike-shell` show "got image" lines

If anything's broken visually, the most likely culprits are:
1. NVIDIA proprietary EGL — the binary reports `libEGL warning`
   on this laptop and falls back to llvmpipe (software). On
   Intel/AMD systems with Mesa it should be fine.
2. Cursor color on light themes — hardcoded `default_fg` is
   light-grey; against a light theme background it might not
   be visible.
3. Font path — hardcoded `/usr/share/fonts/TTF/Hack-Regular.ttf`
   in `src/ui/pane.zig`. If your system doesn't have Hack
   installed, atlas init will fail and the pane will be black.

## What's left

The post-checkpoint TODO list, in rough priority order:

1. IME preedit display at cursor (commit signal works, preedit
   positioning not wired)
2. Pane focus highlight (visual border on the focused pane)
3. Selection extension into scrollback (model accepts negative
   rows; mouse handler doesn't yet map to them)
4. Reflow with soft-wrap tracking on resize (today: pad/truncate)
5. Memory leaks at exit. ~10 leaks reported by GPA on close.
   Most come from `g_signal_connect_data` callsites passing
   `null` as the `GDestroyNotify`, so per-handler ctx structs
   (input.Ctx, menu Slot, RenameCtx, etc.) live until process
   exit. Bounded — one allocation per signal connection per
   widget — but shows up loud in the leak report. Fix: pass a
   destroy function and free the ctx there. (The ctx structs
   need to know their allocator; easiest is `*GeneralPurposeAllocator`
   reachable globally.)
6. OSC 8 in selection-extract — preserves text but not the URI

## Notable design decisions made during the build

- **Zig 0.15.2** with `ReleaseSafe` default — Zig's bundled linker
  cannot handle gcc 15's `.sframe` section in `crt1.o`. Debug
  builds fail with `R_X86_64_PC64` at link. Override via
  `-Doptimize=Debug` only when you have a working LLD ≥ 22.
- **Dirty-bit redraw** — `Pane.onTick` only `queue_draw`s when
  `Screen.dirty` is set. Saves substantial idle CPU on llvmpipe.
- **`drain_pending` atomic** — without it, every byte from a
  high-throughput shell would queue a separate
  `g_main_context_invoke` call. This lets the worker push freely
  while only one main-thread drain is ever scheduled.
- **`extern struct` Cell, 8 bytes** — `packed struct` in Zig is
  bitfield semantics, not byte-aligned. We assert `@sizeOf(Cell)
  == 8` at comptime.
- **Pane is the canonical Terminal `user_ctx`** — Pane forwards
  clipboard / title / image events up to Window via per-callback
  sinks. Avoids a single `user_ctx` collision when both Pane and
  Window need to handle different events.
- **Image rendering as a separate pass** — `ImagePass` has its
  own shader (`u_image` uniform) and is drawn after the grid pass.
  Keeps the grid shader simple (one atlas binding).
- **Stb_image vendored under `vendor/`** — single-header,
  public-domain, compiled as a C source by `build.zig`. Used
  for iTerm2 OSC 1337 PNG decoding.
